Attempt to create face detector filter especially for surveillance cameras

pros:
-- it is very fast
-- it gives you rotated square bounding box to proceed with face recognition
-- it gives you additional face attributes (probabilty of spoofing and mask wearing)

cons:
-- does not work with large faces. But such faces will be found if you decrease image size
